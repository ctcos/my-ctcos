Please use [this guide](http://www67.zippyshare.com/d/Y8mP7mts/3627/Chrome%20APK%20Official%20Apps%20List.pdf) to help you determine which apps are compatible, and which aren't. If the app you want is not on the Guide, the best thing to do is try doing it yourself.**\r\n\r\n## Using Twerk: Instructions\r\n> Wherever there is a star, means I'm directing you to a footnote. One * equals footnote #1. Two **'s equals footnote #2, and so on.\r\n\r\n- If you downloaded the APK onto your computer, this is the program you'll most likely* want to use\r\n- If you don't already have Twerk, download it from the link above.\r\n- Drag & Drop the APK into the Twerk app\r\n- Write the application name. **Example:** If the app is called 'Angry Birds', write 'Angry Birds' in the field\r\n- Change the icon. Right next to the 'Application Name' field, is a 72x72 icon. Click on it. Choose an icon that is 72x72px. If you can only find large icons, go [here](http://resizepic.com) to resize an image.\r\n- Make sure the package name is the **exact** package name that shows up in the Google Play Store link. Nothing more, nothing less.\r\n- Unless the APK is hosted by Google themselves, the ARChon Runtime should always be on\r\n- On the APK guide mentioned above, it should say whether the app should be in phone or tablet format.\r\n\t- Portrait or landscape can only be determined by you. Each app is different.\r\n\t- If you don't want the application to be a fixed size, toggle the switch.\r\n\t- I find that in most cases, it is a good idea to enable the External directory\r\n\t\t- when you open the app, the file manager will open up. Simply, find the place where you keep the app directory, and click 'Enter' on the app directory. This will select the whole app directory, and in most cases, make the app work.\r\n\t- If the app works offline, don't touch the switch. If it doesn't, toggle the switch.\r\n\t- Click the circler red android logo\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10813130/6138007/98fbd17a-b14b-11e4-85f7-6a188b53d785.png\" />\r\n\r\n\t- You are now prompted with yet another file manager. Choose where you want to keep the app directory by simply clicking enter on the folder you clicked on [once]. The app directory will be inside that folder.\r\n- Make sure the app you chose (and have an APK of), is on the Guide mentioned above. If it's **not**, there are a number of things you could do:\r\n\t- Go to the app page on the Google Play Store, if there is a Read More button in the description, click on it.\r\n\t- On your keyboard, hold down 'CTRL' and click 'F' - this searches the page for any words you type in the box\r\n\t- Search for: 'tablet' & (after you erase the word 'tablet',) 'offline'. If, somewhere on the page, it mentions something about tablet & offline compatibility, you can continue on to the next bulletin. If not, skip the next bulletin\r\n\t- **For tablet & offline compatibility:** If compatible with tablet: toggle the switch on the right side of 'Phone'. If compatible with offline: the switch should be blue, with the ball on the right side\r\n\t- **If it doesn't mention anything about tablet & offline compatibility:** You can guess. Chances are, it is compatible on a phone, so don't toggle the switch on the right side of 'Phone'. Keep it on 'Portrait'. Fixed size doesn't matter. Toggle the switch next to 'Disabled External Directory'. Toggle the switch next to 'Offline Enabled'.\r\n\t- Click the red circler android logo at the bottom to create the app\r\n\t- Save it somewhere\r\n\t- Load the Unpacked Extension to chrome://extensions\r\n\t- Run it - if the application crashes after the first time, don't backdown, it'll probably restart again. If after crashing, it doesn't restart, run it again. If it doesn't work, delete the app from the **chrome://extensions page**.\r\n\t\t**This is the last resort for an app that doesn't work with all what I wrote above:**\r\n\t\t- Go to the app directory\r\n\t\t- Find manifest.json\r\n\t\t- Edit it\r\n\t\t- Find `\"custom-android-release-1400197.apk\"` - erase `custom-android-release-1400197.apk`. Instead of that, write `app-release`. It should look like this: `\"app-release\"`.\r\n\t\t- Save the file\r\n\t\t- Load the unpacked extension to chrome://extensions\r\n- If all that didn't work, the app is NOT compatible with ChromeOS\r\n\t- All in all, it's a matter of trial and error.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sometimes Twerk doesn't work. In case it doesn't - I have a guide for that too.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n## Using ARChon Packager: Instructions\r\n> Wherever there is a star, means I'm directing you to a footnote. One * equals footnote #1. Two **'s equals footnote #2, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n- If you already have an application on your phone that you want to turn into a ChromeOS application, this is the app you want.\r\n- Download the app from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bpear.archonpackager&hl=en)\r\n- Don't try downloading this on your Chromebook. I tried, and it didn't work. (It opened up, but when it came to choosing the files, it crashed.)\r\n- Run the application on your Android device\r\n- Click 'Next'\r\n- Click 'Installed application' (or 'Select an APK from phone's storage), then click 'Next'\r\n- Choose an application\r\n- Choose Phone/Tablet mode - be smart. If you know that it won't work on a tablet, then the app won't work if you choose tablet mode.\r\n- Choose orientation/landscape\r\n- Choose 'Enable access to apps files on PC/Chrome\r\n- Tap 'Next' -> Share Chrome Application - email it to yourself/Dropbox/etc.. (I prefer [Aqua Mail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kman.AquaMail&hl=en)\r\n- Download the attachment from the Email on your Chromebook\r\n- Unpack it -> Load the unpacked extension to chrome://extensions\r\n- Enjoy! (Unless of course, the app doesn't work - haven't found a solution for that yet.)\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n## This has been My Contribution to ChromeOS (CTCOS), I hope you found these guides useful! - Yeshourun\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
