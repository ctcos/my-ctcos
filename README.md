# My CTCOS
My Contributions to ChromeOS (CTCOS)

Here, I have Google Play Store applications that are otherwise unavailable for download in ChromeOS format anwywhere ele.
On some of them I worked hard to make into COS applications, and others, were blissfully easy.

My contributions allows you to run many seperate apps on ChromeOS & on any platform that supports Chrome. Enjoy.

## Instructions

- Get [ARChon Custom Runtime](https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/master/archon.md)

- Download a version of this:
	- Either the ARChon Version ( Allows you to run multiple apps and cross-platform. Less Stable) or the Normal Runtime ( More Stable and recommended for ChromeOS users. You can only run one app at a time. Only for ChromeOS users.)
