# My CTCOS
My Contributions to ChromeOS (CTCOS)

Here, I have Google Play Store applications that are otherwise unavailable for download in ChromeOS format anwywhere ele.
On some of them I worked hard to make into COS applications, and others, were blissfully easy.

My contributions allows you to run many seperate apps on ChromeOS & on any platform that supports Chrome. Enjoy.

## Instructions
